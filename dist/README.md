## Installation

To install this application, you will need to clone the repository locally and then instal the inquirer package number 6.3.1. From there you will open the application folder in your terminal and use node to call the index.js file.

## Usage

Once the prompts begin on your screen, you will answer the questions in as much detail and clarity as possible. Please note, the enter key will move you on to the next question. The application takes care of basic formatting, however, if you would like to add some styling to your sections, see this  [Github Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) for a reference as to how to manipulate your text within the terminal to achieve the look you are looking for.
